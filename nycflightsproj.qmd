## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document.
To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code.
You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
#| label: setup
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

```

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
res_mean_rnorm_3dig <- paste("Result:",
                             round(
                               mean(
                                 rnorm(n = 10,
                                       mean = 0, sd = 1)), 
                               digits = 3), sep = "")
res_mean_rnorm_3dig
```

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
res_rnorm <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1)
res_mean_rnorm <- mean(res_rnorm)
res_mean_rnorm_3dig <- round(res_mean_rnorm, digits = 3)
res_mean_rnorm_3dig_string <- paste("Result:", res_mean_rnorm_3dig, sep = "")
# print result
res_mean_rnorm_3dig_string
```

```{r}
#| Using pipes
set.seed(1234)
res_mean_rnorm_3dig_string <- 
  rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1) %>%
  mean() %>%
  round(digits = 3) %>% 
  # The dot '.' is to show where the content of the pipe should be put
  paste("Result:", .)
res_mean_rnorm_3dig_string
```
